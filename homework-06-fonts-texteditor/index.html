        <h1>Like Tears in Rain</h1>
        <h2>Where am I going? How long have I got?</h2>
        <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched
            C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears
            in rain...
            <em>Time to die.</em>
